<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autologous Transplant</li><li>Allogenic Transplant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hematopoietic stem cells transplantation market is categorized into two main types: autologous transplants and allogenic transplants. Autologous transplants involve using the patientâ€™s own stem cells, typically harvested prior to intensive treatment, minimizing the risk of rejection and infection. In contrast, allogenic transplants involve stem cells sourced from a compatible donor, which can be a relative or an unrelated individual, offering potential for a more diverse immune response. Both types are crucial for treating various blood disorders and cancers.</p></p>
