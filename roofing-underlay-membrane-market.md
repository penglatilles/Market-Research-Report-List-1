<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roofing Underlay Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Breathable Underlay</li><li>Breathable Underlay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The roofing underlay membrane market is categorized into two main types: non-breathable underlay and breathable underlay. Non-breathable underlay, typically made from materials that prevent moisture from passing through, is ideal for cold roofs where condensation control is not a concern. In contrast, breathable underlay allows moisture vapor to escape while still providing a barrier against water infiltration. This makes breathable membranes suitable for warm roofs, enhancing energy efficiency and reducing mold growth in roofing structures.</p></p>
