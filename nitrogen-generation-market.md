<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PSA Nitrogen Generators</li><li>Membrane Nitrogen Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nitrogen generation market primarily includes two types: Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) nitrogen generators and membrane nitrogen generators. PSA generators utilize a two-stage process to separate nitrogen from air by adsorbing oxygen onto carbon molecular sieves under pressure, producing high-purity nitrogen. In contrast, membrane nitrogen generators use selective permeability membranes to separate nitrogen from oxygen, offering a more compact and energy-efficient solution. Both technologies cater to various industrial applications, including food packaging, pharmaceuticals, and metal fabrication.</p></p>
