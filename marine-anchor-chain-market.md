<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Anchor Chain Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>StudLink</li><li>StudlessLink</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine anchor chain market is primarily divided into two types: Stud Link and Studless Link chains. Stud Link chains feature protruding studs that enhance the chain's strength and prevent tangling, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications in deep-sea environments. In contrast, Studless Link chains lack these studs, resulting in a smoother profile, which minimizes friction and allows for easier handling; these are typically used in lighter anchoring situations. Each type serves distinct operational needs in maritime activities.</p></p>
