<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Relief Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reclosing Pressure Relief System</li><li>Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure relief systems are essential for maintaining safety in various industries by preventing excessive pressure buildup in equipment. The market is divided into two main types: reclosing pressure relief systems and non-reclosing pressure relief systems. Reclosing systems automatically reset after pressure is relieved, allowing for continuous operation with minimal downtime. In contrast, non-reclosing systems operate as a one-time release mechanism, requiring manual intervention to reset after activation. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring operational safety and compliance with regulatory standards.</p></p>
