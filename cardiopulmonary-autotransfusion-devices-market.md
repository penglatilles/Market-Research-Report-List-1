<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Pump Transfusion Device</li><li>Off-Pump Transfusion Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiopulmonary autotransfusion devices are categorized into two main types: on-pump and off-pump transfusion devices. On-pump transfusion devices are utilized during cardiac surgeries where the heart is temporarily stopped and blood is collected, processed, and reinfused into the patient, optimizing blood management. Off-pump transfusion devices, conversely, operate without the use of a heart-lung machine, allowing for blood collection during minimally invasive procedures. Both types aim to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusions, enhancing patient recovery and safety.</p></p>
