<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Viscosity Bone Cement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Antibiotic</li><li>Without Antibiotic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Low Viscosity Bone Cement market is segmented into two primary types: with antibiotic and without antibiotic. The “with antibiotic” category includes bone cements that incorporate antimicrobial agents to reduce infection risk during orthopedic procedures. In contrast, the “without antibiotic” category comprises traditional cements that primarily focus on providing structural support without additional infection-fighting properties. Both types serve distinct clinical needs, with antibiotic-containing options being particularly beneficial in higher-risk surgeries, while non-antibiotic cements are often preferred for routine applications.</p></p>
